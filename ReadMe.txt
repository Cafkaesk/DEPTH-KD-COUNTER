Hello,

thank you for downloading and installing this application. It is the first Kill/Death-Ratio Counter available for the game "Depth".

Please read the following instruction on how to use this software:

1) Start the program by either double-clicking on "DEPTH_KD_Counter_GUI.ahk" or the "DEPTH-KD-COUNTER.exe" (either on your Desktop, or in the installation folder). This varies on your previous installation/download-choices.

2) These are the important hotkeys for the program:

"Numpad +" = Shows the GUI
"Numpad-" = Hides the GUI
"Strg+Del" = Resets the LOCAL stats
"Strg+Q" = Switches between LOCAL and TOTAL stats

3) The local stats are saved under the following path: 
"(your installation folder)/Scripts/DEPTH_KD.ini". 
The total stats are saved under the following path:
"(your installation folder)/Scripts/DEPTH_KD_global.ini".

4) There is currently no way to reset the total stats, but you can do it by hand, by editing the .ini with a text-editor.

5) The counter may slow down your FPS, due to the used methods. I recommend that you have at least 60-120 FPS (without the application running). If you experience stuttering or FPS outside of the aforementioned range, the counter may lose its reliability.  In this case, you should lower your settings and activate "Smoothed FPS" in the DEPTH-options menu (too high FPS may also influence the counter).

6) Currently, this counter should be ~95% reliable for kill-detection (death-reliabilty should be 100%). This depends, of course, on your PC setup, since I have no budget for extensive testing. 

7.) I tested the counter under the following resolutions: 16:10 - 16:9 - 5:4 - 1366x768 and 4:3. It SHOULD be adaptive, due to some preconfigurations I did - yet - I may not have been able to consider everything. 

8.) You should run "Depth" in Borderless Window mode. Simple fullscreen and window mode won't work (at least not with the counter gui in-game).


If you have further questions/suggestions/bug reports, you may contact me here (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cafkaesk) or via mail (tsamaya-sentle@yandex.com).

Good luck, and have fin,
Cafkaesk
